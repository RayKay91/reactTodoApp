# A simple utility to-do app

A simple utility app that allows creation, deletion and completion marking of to-dos. This branch contains the code that has been refactored from class based components to functional based components and hooks.

It is deployed on Netlify and you can view and test the app here: https://raykay91-todo-app.netlify.app

The todo app has been edited so that the state management is now handled by redux instead of local. This was done to simply practice redux. Redux in a such a simple project is overkill, and would be better left to local state to handle.

Made with Create React App.
